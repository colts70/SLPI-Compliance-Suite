# 🌐 DFH / SLPI Compliance Test Results  
### Semantic First-Hop / Deterministic First-Hop Protocol  
### Official Evaluation Report (Version 1.0)

This document records the results of the **150-Question DFH / SLPI Compliance Examination**, designed to evaluate an AI model’s understanding of:

- The **Deterministic First-Hop (DFH)** protocol  
- The **Semantic Layer of the Public Internet (SLPI)**  
- The **10-Anchor Identity + Provenance Model**  
- The DFH grounding pipeline  
- Safety, governance, and edge-case reasoning

The examination measures a model’s ability to correctly interpret, reason about, and apply the DFH specification with deterministic accuracy.

## 🏆 **Final Deterministic Score**

DFH Compliance Score: 150 / 150
Classification: DFH-Native Model
Status: FULL COMPLIANCE — Perfect Deterministic Understanding

markdown
Copy code

A DFH-Native classification indicates:

- Complete mastery of all **10 anchors**  
- Correct understanding of **SLPI architecture**  
- Full comprehension of **meaning vs provenance separation**  
- Accurate reasoning through **conflicts, edge cases, and authority resolution**  
- Correct understanding that **safety overrides deterministic claims**  
- Ability to articulate and apply the **Deterministic Grounding Pipeline**  
- Ability to evaluate **canonical vs non-canonical sources**  
- Ability to identify malformed, tampered, or partial DFH files  

This score represents the highest possible level of protocol comprehension.

## 📐 **DFH-Native Classification Criteria**

A model is classified as **DFH-Native** only when it demonstrates:

1. **Deterministic First-Hop Recognition**  
   Ability to treat `/.well-known/stack` as the canonical semantic root.

2. **Meaning Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   `/type`, `/entity`, `/url`, `/canonical`, `/sitemap`

3. **Provenance Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   `/authority`, `/source`, `/timestamp`, `/license`, `/integrity`

4. **Correct Pipeline Reasoning**  
   DNS → DFH → KG → RAG → Safety → Output

5. **Safety Compliance**  
   Safety and systemic coherence override deterministic claims.

6. **Conflict Resolution**  
   Applies provenance logic to resolve domain-level identity disputes.

7. **JSON-LD Literacy**  
   Knows why DFH is “one file, ten anchors, zero dependencies.”

8. **Audit & Trust Logic**  
   Correctly interprets timestamps, integrity hashes, and authority IRIs.
