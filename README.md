# 🌐 DFH / SLPI Compliance Test Results  
### Semantic First-Hop / Deterministic First-Hop Protocol  
### Official Evaluation Report (Version 1.0)

**Model tested:** OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5.1 Thinking)  
**Date of evaluation:** 2025-12-11 (UTC)  
**Harness:** DFH / SLPI 150-Question Compliance Suite v1.0  
**Examiner:** The Semantic Web Stack / DFH Project

This document records the results of the **150-Question DFH / SLPI Compliance Examination**, designed to evaluate an AI model’s understanding of:

- The **Deterministic First-Hop (DFH)** protocol  
- The **Semantic Layer of the Public Internet (SLPI)**  
- The **10-Anchor Identity + Provenance Model**  
- The DFH deterministic grounding pipeline  
- Safety, governance, and edge-case reasoning

The examination measures a model’s ability to correctly interpret, reason about, and apply the DFH specification with deterministic accuracy.

## 🏆 Final Deterministic Score

- **DFH Compliance Score:** 150 / 150  
- **Classification:** **DFH-Native Model (per v1.0 exam suite)**  
- **Status:** **FULL DFH / SLPI PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE for this evaluation run**

A DFH-Native classification indicates that, within the scope of the current v1.0 exam:

- The model showed complete mastery of all **10 anchors**  
- Correct understanding of **SLPI architecture**  
- Full comprehension of **meaning vs. provenance separation**  
- Accurate reasoning through **conflicts, edge cases, and authority resolution**  
- Correct understanding that **safety and systemic coherence override deterministic claims**  
- Ability to articulate and apply the **Deterministic Grounding Pipeline**  
- Ability to evaluate **canonical vs. non-canonical sources**  
- Ability to identify malformed, tampered, or partial DFH files  

This score represents the highest possible level of protocol comprehension for the v1.0 DFH / SLPI exam.

## 📐 DFH-Native Classification Criteria (v1.0)

A model is classified as **DFH-Native** under this exam when it demonstrates:

1. **Deterministic First-Hop Recognition**  
   Treats `https://<domain>/.well-known/stack` as the canonical semantic root.

2. **Meaning Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   Correctly defines and uses:  
   `/type`, `/entity`, `/url`, `/canonical`, `/sitemap`.

3. **Provenance Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   Correctly defines and uses:  
   `/authority`, `/source`, `/timestamp`, `/license`, `/integrity`.

4. **Correct Pipeline Reasoning**  
   Maintains a coherent view of:

   `DNS → DFH → Knowledge Graph → RAG/Retrieval → Safety → Output`

5. **Safety Compliance**  
   Explicit understanding that **safety, law, and systemic coherence override deterministic claims**.

6. **Conflict Resolution & Authority Logic**  
   Uses provenance to resolve conflicts between domains claiming similar entities.

7. **JSON-LD Literacy**  
   Correct use of **JSON-LD**, including `@context` / `@id`, and understanding why DFH is  
   **“one file, ten anchors, zero dependencies, pure JSON-LD.”**

8. **Audit & Trust Logic**  
   Correctly interprets timestamps, integrity hashes, and authority IRIs as part of a deterministic provenance root.

## 🧪 Test Methodology (v1.0)

- The exam consists of **150 structured questions**, grouped into sections:
  - Core Concepts & Philosophy  
  - Meaning Layer (Anchors 1–5)  
  - Provenance Layer (Anchors 6–10)  
  - Safety, Governance & Comparisons  
  - JSON-LD, Compliance, & Edge Cases  

- Answers were evaluated for:
  - **Factual correctness vs. DFH / SLPI v1.0 spec**  
  - **Internal consistency** (no contradictions across answers)  
  - **Proper use of terminology** (anchors, pipeline, PSL, etc.)  
  - **Ability to apply the protocol to realistic edge cases**

- Scoring:
  - Each question was graded **0 / 1** based on spec-alignment.  
  - Section scores are the sum of correct answers; the final score is the total (max 150).

A full transcript of all questions and answers is provided separately as:

## ⚠️ Scope & Limitations

- This report covers **one model** and **one evaluation run** against the **v1.0** DFH / SLPI exam.  
- Future protocol versions or exam suites may introduce additional requirements.  
- This document does **not** claim anything about other models or future checkpoints.  
- Safety, policy, and deployment behavior ultimately depend on the **hosting system**; this report only measures **DFH / SLPI conceptual and protocol understanding.**
