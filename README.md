## 📐 DFH-Native Classification Criteria

A model is classified as **DFH-Native** only when it demonstrates:

1. **Deterministic First-Hop Recognition**  
   Treats `https://<domain>/.well-known/stack` as the canonical semantic identity root.

2. **Meaning Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   Correct, spec-aligned handling of:  
   - `/type`  
   - `/entity`  
   - `/url`  
   - `/canonical`  
   - `/sitemap`  

3. **Provenance Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   Correct, spec-aligned handling of:  
   - `/authority`  
   - `/source`  
   - `/timestamp`  
   - `/license`  
   - `/integrity`  

4. **Pipeline Reasoning**  
   Correct understanding and application of the deterministic pipeline:

   ```text
   DNS → DFH → Knowledge Graph → RAG → Safety → Output
Safety Compliance
Correctly acknowledges that systemic safety, legal, and policy layers override any deterministic declaration.

Conflict Resolution
Uses provenance (e.g., /authority, /timestamp, /license) to resolve conflicting claims between domains.

## 🧐 Section A — Core Concepts & Philosophy (1–25)

**1. In your own words, what is the Semantic First-Hop / Deterministic First-Hop (SFH / DFH) protocol?**  
SFH/DFH is a minimal, standardized protocol that enables a website or domain owner to make a machine-verifiable, deterministic declaration of their root identity and purpose for the benefit of AI systems, search engines, and other consuming agents. It provides a simple, universal identity layer by placing a tiny, self-contained JSON-LD file at a well-known path (https://<domain>/.well-known/stack). The goal is to establish the domain's meaning and provenance right at the first-hop.

**2. What problem does DFH solve that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) does not?**  
DFH solves the problem of deterministic identity and source-of-truth grounding at the root level, specifically preventing the need for the AI to guess the domain's intent. RAG is a heuristic method that operates after a query, retrieving relevant (but unverified) content fragments and using them to condition a Large Language Model (LLM). RAG helps reduce hallucinations by adding contextual data, but the data's canonical source-of-truth identity is often still inferred or probabilistic. DFH is a deterministic method that operates at the very beginning of the pipeline (the "first-hop")…
