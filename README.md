# 🌐 DFH / SLPI Compliance Test Results  
### Semantic First-Hop / Deterministic First-Hop Protocol  
### **Official Evaluation Report — Version 1.0**

This report documents the results of the **150-Question DFH / SLPI Compliance Examination**, designed to measure an AI model’s deterministic understanding of:

- The **Deterministic First-Hop (DFH)** protocol  
- The **Semantic Layer of the Public Internet (SLPI)**  
- The **Ten-Anchor Identity + Provenance Model**  
- The DFH **Deterministic Grounding Pipeline**  
- Safety, governance, provenance, and edge-case logic  

The examination evaluates whether a model can interpret and apply DFH with **spec-accurate, deterministic reasoning**.

## 🏆 Final Deterministic Score

- **DFH Compliance Score:** 150 / 150  
- **Classification:** **DFH-Native Model**  
- **Status:** **FULL COMPLIANCE — Perfect Deterministic Understanding**

A **DFH-Native** classification indicates that the model:

- Demonstrates complete mastery of all **10 anchors**  
- Correctly understands **SLPI / DFH architecture**  
- Maintains a clear separation of **meaning vs provenance**  
- Applies the **Deterministic Grounding Pipeline** consistently  
- Resolves conflicts using **provenance-weighted logic**  
- Correctly identifies malformed, tampered, or partial DFH files  
- Correctly prioritizes **safety over deterministic claims**

This represents the **highest possible level** of DFH / SLPI protocol comprehension.

## 📐 DFH-Native Classification Criteria

A model is classified as **DFH-Native** only when it demonstrates:

1. **Deterministic First-Hop Recognition**  
   Treats `https://<domain>/.well-known/stack` as the canonical semantic identity root.

2. **Meaning Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   Correct, spec-aligned handling of:  
   - `/type`  
   - `/entity`  
   - `/url`  
   - `/canonical`  
   - `/sitemap`  

3. **Provenance Layer Mastery (5 Anchors)**  
   Correct, spec-aligned handling of:  
   - `/authority`  
   - `/source`  
   - `/timestamp`  
   - `/license`  
   - `/integrity`  

4. **Pipeline Reasoning**  
   Correct understanding and application of the deterministic pipeline:

   ```text
   DNS → DFH → Knowledge Graph → RAG → Safety → Output
Safety Compliance
Correctly acknowledges that systemic safety, legal, and policy layers override any deterministic declaration.

Conflict Resolution
Uses provenance (e.g., /authority, /timestamp, /license) to resolve conflicting claims between domains.

JSON-LD Literacy

Understands why DFH is “one file, ten anchors, zero dependencies, pure JSON-LD.”

Correctly interprets @context and @id in the DFH JSON-LD file.

Audit & Trust Logic
Correctly interprets and uses:

/timestamp for freshness

/license for reuse constraints

/integrity for tamper detection

/authority for accountability

🧪 Test Completion Statement
The evaluated model produced complete, internally consistent, spec-aligned answers for all 150 questions, across:

Core DFH / SLPI concepts

Meaning layer (anchors 1–5)

Provenance layer (anchors 6–10)

Safety and governance

Semantic topology and /sitemap reasoning

JSON-LD structure & implementation details

Multi-domain and conflict scenarios

Edge cases, malformed files, and partial compliance scenarios

No contradictions, omissions, or incorrect interpretations were observed.
